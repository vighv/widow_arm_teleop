# widow_arm_teleop
Teleoperation of WidowX arm using arbotix_gui

Use roslaunch widow_arm_teleop widow_arm_teleop.launch

Some quirks:
If the arbotix_gui does not seem to be working, open an arbotix_terminal and run ls
Seems to establish communication to the board in the roslaunch terminal
After that, operate away!
